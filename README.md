# react-typewrite
## Description
ReactJS component that simulates the effect of typing on a text editor

## Installation

    npm install react-typewrite --save. 

## Usage
Just require the component and use it on your ReactJS app.
Don't forget to include the component stylesheet, located in ``build/react-typewrite.css``. How you'll include the component style - either by requiring it, including directly on the html, importing it - is up to you, just make sure you're using it so that the cursor can blink.

## Contributing

``npm install && npm start `` for starting the webpack-dev-server with the demo page.
